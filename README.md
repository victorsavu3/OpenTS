# OpenTS

OpenTS is a community-led, open-source reconstruction of *Command & Conquer:
Tiberian Sun*. Instead of patching or extending the retail executable, it
rebuilds the engine as a standalone program.

OpenTS gives equal weight to two goals: maintaining a playable engine and
providing a capable platform for modding and engine development. Work on one
goal should not come at the expense of the other.

OpenTS is:

- an independent, community-led source reconstruction targeting Tiberian Sun
  2.03 Firestorm;
- a playable engine based on Electronic Arts' GPL-released source for related
  Command & Conquer games and Tiberian Sun-specific reverse engineering; and
- the active base for maintenance, documentation, modernization, bug fixes,
  and new modding capabilities.

OpenTS is not:

- a remaster or remake;
- an official Electronic Arts source release; or
- a distribution of the original game assets.

OpenTS is an independent community project and is not affiliated with or
endorsed by Electronic Arts.

## Community

- Discord: <https://opents.net/discord>
- Bug reports and proposals:
  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/OpenTS-Developers/OpenTS/issues)

## Downloads

- **Releases** are the recommended builds. Every release on the
  [releases page](https://github.com/OpenTS-Developers/OpenTS/releases) carries
  a zip per platform, `OpenTS-<version>-Win32.zip` and
  `OpenTS-<version>-x64.zip`, each containing `Game.exe`, `Game.pdb`, and the
  `ui/` directory of screen documents. The 32-bit build runs on both 32-bit and
  64-bit Windows and has the longer runtime history; the 64-bit build runs on
  64-bit Windows only. The 0.1.0 zip has no `ui/` and carries the
  `Language.dll` that release loads.
- **Nightly builds** are development snapshots from the
  [Engine nightly](https://github.com/OpenTS-Developers/OpenTS/actions/workflows/engine-nightly.yml)
  workflow. Download the latest one without a GitHub account through
  [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/OpenTS-Developers/OpenTS/workflows/engine-nightly/main).
  Nightlies contain the latest merged changes without release validation and
  expire after 90 days.

## Installing

1. Install Tiberian Sun from Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on
   Steam or the EA App.
2. Extract the release zip into the Tiberian Sun game directory.
3. Run `Game.exe`.

OpenTS supports Windows 10 version 1903 (build 18362) and newer. Earlier
Windows versions are untested and unsupported. Wine may work, but there is no
supported native Linux build.

Keep a saved game with the platform that wrote it, and play a network game with
peers on the same platform. The 32-bit and 64-bit builds write saves and
network packets at their own pointer widths, and neither checks which platform
produced what it is reading, so a mismatch surfaces as a failed load or a
desync.

OpenTS supplies the engine, not the game data: the installation above
provides the original assets. There is no installer, and no extra runtime
library or launch argument is required.

## Documentation

The [OpenTS manual](https://opents-developers.github.io/OpenTS/) documents
setup, runtime behavior, INI configuration, mapping, and source-level
internals.

## State and plans

Release 0.1.0 runs the full Tiberian Sun 2.03 Firestorm game. The GDI, Nod,
and Firestorm campaigns, skirmish, and save/load have received full
play-through testing. LAN multiplayer has had more limited testing. No
user-visible regression from the original game is currently known. The
renderer uses
[bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) and supports modern resolutions
through 4K, including ultrawide.

The first of the project's three development milestones is the current focus:

1. CnCNet and CnCNet client support, including porting the parts of
   [ts-patches](https://github.com/CnCNet/ts-patches) this requires.
2. Feature parity with
   [Vinifera](https://github.com/Vinifera-Developers/Vinifera) and the rest
   of ts-patches.
3. Extending Tiberian Sun with new features, striving toward feature parity
   with Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge, and growing engine capabilities that
   match or exceed the popular Yuri's Revenge engine extensions.

Alongside these goals, the engine is modernized incrementally toward an
entity-component architecture, and new development is shaped so that
migration stays possible. [Project direction](docs/DIRECTION.md) explains the
reasoning.

## Building

OpenTS builds for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2022 and CMake.
[Building OpenTS](docs/BUILDING.md) documents the exact requirements,
commands, and outputs.

## Contributing

Bug reports, proposals, documentation improvements, and focused pull requests
are welcome. Review capacity is limited, so discuss non-trivial work with the
maintainers before implementing it. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
explains the current priorities and review policy; source conventions are in
[Style](docs/STYLE.md).

## Origins

OpenTS continues the community reconstruction preserved in the
[TibSun archive](https://github.com/OpenTS-Developers/TibSun), built from
Electronic Arts' published source for related Command & Conquer games and
completed through reverse engineering against the original executable.
[History](docs/HISTORY.md) records the reconstruction's lineage and methods.
