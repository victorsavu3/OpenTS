 *    This will bias a file by giving it an artificial starting position and length. By        *
 *    using this routine, it is possible to 'fool' the file into ignoring a header and         *
 *    trailing extra data. An example of this would be a file inside of a mixfile.             *
 *                                                                                             *

 *          length   -- The forced length of the file. For files that are opened for write,    *
 *                      this serves as the artificial constraint on the file's length. For     *
 *                      files opened for read, this limits the usable file size.               *
