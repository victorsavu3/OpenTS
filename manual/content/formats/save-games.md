The save dialog creates `.SAV` files. Each file begins with a fixed header and a table of the details the load dialog lists a save by, followed by the game state as one compressed block. The listing is read from the header and table alone. A file that is truncated, damaged, or written by a later format version is refused before anything is loaded. A save is written under a temporary name and moved into place once complete, so an interrupted save leaves the previous file intact.

## Where the files are

Saved games keep to a `Saved Games` folder of their own, beside the game or inside the [user directory](/using/game-data/) when one is named. The folder is created the first time the game asks for a saved game. Every save, load, listing and deletion names that folder outright. Unlike the files the game reads, a saved game is never looked for anywhere else. A client that browses saved games reads that one location rather than a search path, whichever layout the game was installed in.

The dialog names a new save `SAVE` followed by four hexadecimal digits, drawing again until it finds a name no existing file answers to. Saving over a listed game reuses that game's name. A multiplayer save is written under a numbered name instead, and never appears in the campaign or skirmish list. The random map generator keeps its saved settings in the same folder, under names of its own. The map a host generates for a match is not one of them: it stays with the game's files so that it can travel to the other machines.

## When the file is written

A campaign or skirmish save requested through the save dialog is written immediately while that dialog has the scenario paused. A multiplayer click instead submits a synchronized `SAVEGAME` command. When that command executes, each peer copies one pending filename and description. Duplicate commands before the frame ends share that one request. The file is written only after the command queue has finished and the end-of-frame deletion pass has retired every object already marked for removal.

The [Create Autosave](/mapping/actions/taction-create-autosave/) trigger action requests an automatic save at that same frame boundary, using the slots and descriptions below. It works even when the timed interval is disabled, including multiplayer games started from the menu. Repeated trigger requests in one frame share one save. A pending multiplayer save keeps its filename, description, saving-box setting, and the notice it posts. A trigger-requested save posts no notice of its own and is reported only when it fails. Playback writes nothing.

Once a connection is destroyed or a synchronized `REMOVEPLAYER` command executes, multiplayer saving is disabled for the rest of that match. Any pending request is cancelled. The options dialog disables its Save button in that state. Restarting the mission does not restore the button or accept another request. Selecting and starting a new game does.

A save reports its outcome in the message list rather than in a box. One the player asked for reads `Game saved.` when the file is written. Any save that could not be written says so. The line is posted at the frame boundary rather than where the save ran, so a save made from the menus is reported when the player returns to the map. Each machine of a network match reports the file it wrote itself. The [random map generator](/systems/map-generation/) is the exception: its save dialog confirms with a box, since it saves settings rather than a game and runs with no scenario behind it.

## Automatic saves

The game also saves on its own at a fixed interval of frames. A game started from the menu uses the interval [`AutoSaveInterval`](/keys/autosaveinterval/) names, and a [client-launched](/formats/spawn-ini/#automatic-saves) game uses the interval its launch file names. When the interval runs out, `Auto-saving...` is posted to the message list, and the save is written at the next frame boundary, after the notice has been drawn. It goes through the same request the synchronized multiplayer save uses. The same line then becomes `Game auto-saved.`, or says the save could not be written, so an automatic save leaves one line whatever its outcome. The interval starts over from any completed save, whoever asked for it, and from a load or a mission restart. A resumed or restarted game therefore waits a full interval before its first.

A campaign writes `AUTOSAVE1.SAV` through `AUTOSAVE5.SAV` in turn and then starts over, and a skirmish writes `AUTOSAVE_SKIRMISH1.SAV` through `AUTOSAVE_SKIRMISH5.SAV` the same way. The two rings turn independently. Each is described as `Auto-Save`, its slot number and the scenario's description, so a listing tells it apart from a save the player named. Every save records the slot that follows the last one written, in both rings, and a loaded game continues from what its save records. The rings keep their positions for as long as the game runs, so a new game started from the menu carries on where the last automatic save left off rather than overwriting it. A client-launched game starts where its launch file says.

Timed saves in a game against other machines run only when a launch file set the interval. Every machine must write the same frame, and a match arranged from the menu leaves each machine with settings of its own. Each machine then writes the next [numbered save](#numbered-multiplayer-saves), described as `Multiplayer Game (Auto-Save)`. It goes through the pending request, without the saving box a manual save shows. Once multiplayer saving is disabled for the match, automatic saves stop with it.

## Mission checkpoints

A campaign mission writes two further saves of its own, independent of the rotating automatic saves above: neither counts against the ring, and neither is pruned by it.

With [`CampaignAutosaveOnMissionStart=yes`](/keys/campaignautosaveonmissionstart/), a mission writes `AUTOSAVE_START_<scenario>.SAV` as soon as it starts, described `Start of mission: <name>` in the load dialog. `<scenario>` is the mission's own file name, so restarting or replaying the mission overwrites this same file rather than adding another.

With [`CampaignAutosaveBeforeVictory=yes`](/keys/campaignautosavebeforevictory/), a won mission writes `AUTOSAVE_VICTORY_<scenario>.SAV` right before the map selection screen, described `Before choosing the next mission: <name>`. Loading this save skips the win movie and score screen it was written after and goes straight to map selection, so a different next mission can be chosen than was chosen the first time. A mission that skips map selection with [`SkipMapSelect=yes`](/keys/skipmapselect/) writes no such save, since there is no choice to redo. Winning the mission again overwrites the same file.

Both keys apply only to a single-player campaign. Skirmish and multiplayer games write neither save.

## Quick saves

The [`QuickSave`](/commands/quicksave/) command writes a campaign to `QUICKSAVE.SAV` and a skirmish to `QUICKSAVE_SKIRMISH.SAV`, replacing the previous file of that kind, so a skirmish never writes over a campaign. The save is written at the frame boundary after the key was pressed, once the frame has retired its dead objects. It runs behind the saving box a menu save shows, and the message list then reports `Game saved.` or that the game could not be saved. Each file is described as `Quick Save` and the scenario's description, and the load dialog lists it like any other save. A quick save starts the automatic-save interval over like any completed save.

[`QuickLoad`](/commands/quickload/) restores the file for the kind of game being played. It first reads the file's listing fields and refuses, with a line in the message list, when the file is missing or has another version's stamp. Otherwise the load runs when the frame ends, in the place the options menu runs, and the mission clock resumes in the restored game. A load that fails partway through the restore shows the same error box as the load dialog and leaves the player in the options menu.

Both are refused under **Any of:**

- playback is running;
- a scripted sequence has locked input;
- the game is not a campaign or a skirmish;
- the game is already being won or lost.

Both arrive unbound.

## Numbered multiplayer saves

A game against other machines writes every save, timed or from the options menu, as `SVGM_nnn.NET`, numbered from `SVGM_000.NET` at the first number no file holds, so a match's saves count up in step on every machine. When a new match starts, the game deletes the numbered files a previous match left, along with that match's launch-file copy. A client-launched match then writes a fresh copy of its launch file beside its first save as `spawnSG.ini`, which the CnCNet client reads to resume the match. A resumed match keeps its files and carries the numbering on. The client used to do both itself when a save named `SAVEGAME.NET` appeared and it renamed the file. That name is no longer written.

## Loading during a match

In a game against other machines the master can load one of the match's saved games while it is being played, from the options menu or from the [out-of-sync dialog](/systems/out-of-sync-recovery/). The list offers the match's numbered saves. A file stamped by another version or made in another kind of game is skipped. Reading a file's header costs a disk open, so only the newest thirty-two files by write time are read, which keeps the other machines from waiting on a long scan. Picking one asks every machine to load the save of that number from its own folder five seconds later. Each machine discards what it received and sent for the running match, reads the save, and matches the seats it holds to the saved houses by name. It then rebuilds its connections and synchronizes at the save's frame as a resumed save does, where files that do not match are refused. A player who has left since the save was written fights on under the computer. Multiplayer saving is allowed again once the loaded game runs, since it seats exactly the machines present. No save is written while a load is pending, and a machine whose load fails signs off and leaves the match.

## What the file holds

The field table holds the description shown in the list, the player's house, the campaign and scenario numbers, and the game type. It also holds three timestamps, the name of the program that wrote the save, and the build version of the game that wrote it. The header holds the format's own version.

The game state is a fixed sequence of records: the scenario, the environment, the rules, the map, the loose global values, and every list of type definitions and runtime objects. It is written and read back in that same order. Among the loose values are the looping sounds left at waypoints by [Play Sound Effect At](/mapping/actions/taction-play-sound-at/), each as the sound and its place. The playing sound itself is not saved, and starts again on the first sound tick after the load. Each list stores its own length ahead of its members, and each member writes out the members its class declares, in the order that class lists them. What a save holds is therefore a field-by-field record of each object rather than a copy of the bytes it occupied in memory. Type definitions travel with the save, so a save holds the rules types it was made with rather than looking them up again on load. Artwork does not travel with it: once a restored type's members have been read, its shape and voxel pointers are released and fetched from the archives again. A save loaded against a changed set of files therefore gets the current artwork. One piece does not come back. A UnitType drawn from shapes is given a [voxel turret](/formats/vxl-hva/) when the rules are read, by a routine no restore calls. The restore takes the ordinary voxel path instead, which releases that turret along with the body model it could not find. Its voxel barrel is fetched back, and the barrel is what the shape path draws.

The scenario record also holds the scenario file itself, name and bytes, where [`CarryScenarioFile`](/formats/opents-ini/#what-a-save-carries) in `OPENTS.INI` asks for it. The record is written either way, empty when nothing is included. A [restart or replay](/systems/campaign-progression/#losing-and-restarting) after a load reads that copy, not the file on disk, which a client resuming the save may have replaced. A random map holds no file.

## What is checked

The project-version stamp decides whether a file is offered at all, and only the running version's stamp is accepted. The load dialog reads the header and field table of every `.SAV` in the saved-games folder. It skips every file stamped by anything else, including another OpenTS release-cycle version. A file in the compound-document layout that earlier OpenTS releases and Tiberian Sun wrote is not a saved game to this reader and is skipped as well; there is no conversion. A save that reaches the engine without passing through the dialog, as a network save or one resumed from a [launch file](/formats/spawn-ini/) does, is checked the same way and refused. Development snapshots within one cycle share the stamp, and their save layouts may still differ. A listed save that was not made in a campaign is marked with a leading `*`.

Beyond that stamp and the add-on the scenario declares, nothing about a save is measured against the game it is being loaded into. A save made under one set of rules and loaded under another is not detected. The type definitions stored in the file are simply restored over the ones the rules built.

The file is read and checked in full, checksums included, before the running game is touched, so a truncated or damaged file is refused at no cost. Restoring the game state clears the scenario first, then gives up at the first record it cannot restore. A load that stops there fails, rather than carrying on into a scenario that was cleared and never refilled.
