## Configuration fails before compilation

A message that `thirdparty/bgfx.cmake` is empty means the clone did not fetch the vendored renderer. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` and configure again.

Use the Visual Studio 2022 generator with `-A Win32` or `-A x64`. The build supports no other compilers, Visual Studio versions, or target architectures. Configuring a platform over a build directory that already holds the other one fails; give each its own directory.

For a Visual Studio installation that CMake cannot discover through the Visual Studio Installer, pass its installation path and product version as described in the repository's `docs/BUILDING.md`.

## The executable is not in the run directory

Builds write their runnable files to `build/bin/<configuration>/` and copy nothing into `Run/`:

- Debug: `GameD.exe`, `GameD.pdb`, `GameD.map`, and the `ui/` directory
- Release: `Game.exe`, `Game.pdb`, `Game.map`, and the `ui/` directory

## The executable cannot initialize game data

Name the game data directory with `-DATADIR=`, and confirm it holds data from a legitimate Tiberian Sun installation. The repository and CMake build directory do not supply proprietary game assets.
